    "In practice, creating accurate models from this kind of RNN is difficult. We will get better results if we call `detach` less often, and have more layers—this gives our RNN a longer time horizon to learn from, and richer features to create. But it also means we have a deeper model to train. The key challenge in the development of deep learning has been figuring out how to train these kinds of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this is challenging is because of what happens when you multiply by a matrix many times. Think about what happens when you multiply by a number many times. For example, if you multiply by 2, starting at 1, you get the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8,... after 32 steps you are already at 4,294,967,296. A similar issue happens if you multiply by 0.5: you get 0.5, 0.25, 0.125… and after 32 steps it's 0.00000000023. As you can see, multiplying by a number even slightly higher or lower than 1 results in an explosion or disappearance of our starting number, after just a few repeated multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because matrix multiplication is just multiplying numbers and adding them up, exactly the same thing happens with repeated matrix multiplications. And that's all a deep neural network is —each extra layer is another matrix multiplication. This means that it is very easy for a deep neural network to end up with extremely large or extremely small numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem, because the way computers store numbers (known as \"floating point\") means that they become less and less accurate the further away the numbers get from zero. The diagram in <<float_prec>>, from the excellent article [\"What You Never Wanted to Know About Floating Point but Will Be Forced to Find Out\"](http://www.volkerschatz.com/science/float.html), shows how the precision of floating-point numbers varies over the number line."

    "This inaccuracy means that often the gradients calculated for updating the weights end up as zero or infinity for deep networks. This is commonly referred to as the *vanishing gradients* or *exploding gradients* problem. It means that in SGD, the weights are either not updated at all or jump to infinity. Either way, they won't improve with training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have developed a number of ways to tackle this problem, which we will be discussing later in the book. One option is to change the definition of a layer in a way that makes it less likely to have exploding activations. We'll look at the details of how this is done in <<chapter_convolutions>>, when we discuss batch normalization, and <<chapter_resnet>>, when we discuss ResNets, although these details don't generally matter in practice (unless you are a researcher that is creating new approaches to solving this problem). Another strategy for dealing with this is by being careful about initialization, which is a topic we'll investigate in <<chapter_foundations>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For RNNs, there are two types of layers that are frequently used to avoid exploding activations: *gated recurrent units* (GRUs) and *long short-term memory* (LSTM) layers. Both of these are available in PyTorch, and are drop-in replacements for the RNN layer. We will only cover LSTMs in this book; there are plenty of good tutorials online explaining GRUs, which are a minor variant on the LSTM design."

    "LSTM is an architecture that was introduced back in 1997 by Jürgen Schmidhuber and Sepp Hochreiter. In this architecture, there are not one but two hidden states.

    "\n",

Let's take a closer look at how this is achieved and build an LSTM from scratch."

    "In this picture, our input $x_{t}$ enters on the left with the previous hidden state ($h_{t-1}$) and cell state ($c_{t-1}$). The four orange boxes represent four layers (our neural nets) with the activation being either sigmoid ($\\sigma$) or tanh. tanh is just a sigmoid function rescaled to the range -1 to 1. Its mathematical expression can be written like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's go over the four neural nets (called *gates*) one by one and explain the diagram—but before this, notice how very little the cell state (at the top) is changed. It doesn't even go directly through a neural net! This is exactly why it will carry on a longer-term state.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the arrows for input and old hidden state are joined together. In the RNN we wrote earlier in this chapter, we were adding them together. In the LSTM, we stack them in one big tensor. This means the dimension of our embeddings (which is the dimension of $x_{t}$) can be different than the dimension of our hidden state. If we call those `n_in` and `n_hid`, the arrow at the bottom is of size `n_in + n_hid`; thus all the neural nets (orange boxes) are linear layers with `n_in + n_hid` inputs and `n_hid` outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first gate (looking from left to right) is called the *forget gate*. Since it’s a linear layer followed by a sigmoid, its output will consist of scalars between 0 and 1. We multiply this result by the cell state to determine which information to keep and which to throw away: values closer to 0 are discarded and values closer to 1 are kept. This gives the LSTM the ability to forget things about its long-term state. For instance, when crossing a period or an `xxbos` token, we would expect to it to (have learned to) reset its cell state.\n",

    "The second gate is called the *input gate*. It works with the third gate (which doesn't really have a name but is sometimes called the *cell gate*) to update the cell state. For instance, we may see a new gender pronoun, in which case we'll need to replace the information about gender that the forget gate removed. Similar to the forget gate, the input gate decides which elements of the cell state to update (values close to 1) or not (values close to 0). The third gate determines what those updated values are, in the range of –1 to 1 (thanks to the tanh function). The result is then added to the cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last gate is the *output gate*. It determines which information from the cell state to use to generate the output. The cell state goes through a tanh before being combined with the sigmoid output from the output gate, and the result is the new hidden state.\n",

    "Recurrent neural networks, in general, are hard to train, because of the problem of vanishing activations and gradients we saw before. Using LSTM (or GRU) cells makes training easier than with vanilla RNNs, but they are still very prone to overfitting. Data augmentation, while a possibility, is less often used for text data than for images because in most cases it requires another model to generate random augmentations (e.g., by translating the text into another language and then back into the original language). Overall, data augmentation for text data is currently not a well-explored space.\n",

This paper showed how effective use of *dropout*, *activation regularization*, and *temporal activation regularization* could allow an LSTM to beat state-of-the-art results that previously required much more complicated models. The authors called an LSTM using these techniques an *AWD-LSTM*. We'll look at each of these techniques in turn."
